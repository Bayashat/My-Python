#   A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.
                                        ###   <1> Local Scope
1) A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.

def myfunc():
  x = 300
  print(x)

myfunc()

2) Function Inside Function
As explained in the example above, the variable x is not available outside the function, but it is available for any function inside the function:

The local variable can be accessed from a function within the function:
def myfunc():
  x = 300
  def myinnerfunc():
    print(x)
  myinnerfunc()

myfunc()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          ###   <2>Global Scope
A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope.
Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.
1) 
x = 300

def myfunc():
  print(x)

myfunc()
print(x)

2) Naming Variables
If you operate with the same variable name inside and outside of a function, Python will treat them as two separate variables, one available in the global scope (outside the function) and one available in the local scope (inside the function):

The function will print the local x, and then the code will print the global x:
x = 300

def myfunc():
  x = 200
  print(x)

myfunc()

print(x)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          ###   <3> Global Keyword
If you need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the global keyword.
The global keyword makes the variable global.

1) Example
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = 300

myfunc()
print(x)

2) Also, use the global keyword if you want to make a change to a global variable inside a function.
To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:
x = 300

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = 200

myfunc()

print(x)
